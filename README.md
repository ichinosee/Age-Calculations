# Age-Calculations


Overview
An app that calculates your age by entering your date of birth

## Description
I made an application that calculates the age by inputting the date of birth while being aware of the mvc model. The role of the servlet requests the model to process the actual business.
The servlet asks the view for the answer from the model. jsp is usually used for view. jsp reduces the complexity of java code by allowing you to focus on displaying the data.
